=================================


Required Software
-----------------

This project is about to build a Speech Recognition System for English Word Pronunciation based on Spinx-4, which s a state-of-the-art speech recognition system written entirely in the JavaTM programming language by Carnegie Mellon University(CMU)

1. Sphinx-4 has been built and tested on the Solaris TM Operating Environment, Mac OS X, Linux and Win32 operating systems. Running, building, and testing Sphinx-4 requires additional software. Before you start, you will need the following software available on your machine.

2. Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 5.0 or better. Go to java.sun.com, and select "J2SE". At the time of writing, the latest release version is 6.0 (also referred to as 1.6.0), which is the one we recommend.

3. Ant 1.6.0 or better, available at ant.apache.org. The site has a manual with instructions on how to download, install, and use ant. You will only need ant if you wish to build Sphinx-4 from the source distribution.

4. Git is a distributed version control system. Git originates from the Linux kernel development and is used by many popular Open Source projects, e.g. the Android or the Eclipse Open Source projects, as well as by many commercial organizations.The core of Git was originally written in the programming language C but Git has also been re-implemented in other languages, e.g. Java, Ruby and Python.
